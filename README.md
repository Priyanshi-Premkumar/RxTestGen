RxTestGen: An AI-Powered Test Case Generation Tool
RxTestGen is a prototype for an AI-powered solution designed to automatically generate test cases from user requirements. By leveraging machine learning, the tool streamlines the often time-consuming process of test case creation, helping development and quality assurance teams work more efficiently.

Core Problem & Solution
Current methods for creating test cases are largely manual, leading to a number of challenges:

Time-Consuming: The process is tedious and can slow down the development lifecycle.

Incompleteness: Manual creation can lead to missed edge cases and gaps in test coverage.

Inconsistency: Without a standardized approach, test cases can be inconsistent in quality and detail.

RxTestGen addresses these problems by providing a user-friendly platform that automates the generation of test cases, ensuring they are comprehensive, consistent, and created in a fraction of the time.

Key Features
The prototype offers a clear and intuitive process:

Requirements Input: Users can input their requirements by typing them directly into a text box or by uploading a document.

AI-Powered Generation: The solution's core AI model processes the requirements and generates a list of detailed test cases.

Review and Edit: Users can review the generated test cases, making any necessary edits, reordering them, or deleting them as needed.

Export: Once finalized, the test cases can be exported in various formats, such as CSV or Word documents, for use in other systems.

Technology Stack
RxTestGen is built on a modern, scalable technology stack:

Frontend: The user interface is built with a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js, ensuring a responsive and interactive experience.

Backend: The application's core logic is powered by Python, leveraging its robust ecosystem for AI and data processing.

AI/ML: The AI model is built using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, or can be integrated with a cloud-based service like Google AI Platform.

Hosting: The application is hosted on Firebase App Hosting, a serverless platform that provides seamless deployment, scalability, and integration with other Google services.

Architecture
The solution's architecture is designed for efficiency and scalability. It follows a service-oriented model with a clear separation of concerns:

UI Layer: The web application that handles all user interactions.

Application Layer: A backend server that manages user requests and orchestrates the flow of data.

AI Service: A dedicated microservice that performs the heavy lifting of processing requirements and generating test cases.

Data Storage: A database that stores user data, requirements, and generated test cases.
