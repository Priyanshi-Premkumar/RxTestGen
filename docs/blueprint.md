## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#77B5FE) to convey trust, security, and a connection to healthcare without being overly clinical.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), providing a clean, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: Muted green (#90EE90) for action items and key indicators, promoting ease of use and clear guidance.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif which combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality. Using PT Sans in this case helps balance sophistication with approachability, suitable for software aimed at the healthcare industry.
- Use clear, simple icons representing actions and data types. Ensure icons are easily recognizable to reduce cognitive load.
- Employ a clean, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy. Use white space generously to avoid a cluttered look and promote easy scanning of information.
- Subtle animations to guide the user through key workflows and provide feedback on actions. Animations should be short, purposeful, and not distracting.
